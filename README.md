# C++ Final Project

This is a final project created for my CS200 programming course. I needed to create a To-Do List that was able to add, view, and remove tasks from a list.
The requirements were the following:

The To-Do List application must be developed using the C++ programming language.
The application should utilize variables, arrays, and data structures like structs or classes to manage tasks. You can use an array or container to store the tasks, and each task may have additional information such as a due date or priority level.
Implement loops and selection structures to enable users to add, view, and remove tasks. Consider using a menu-driven system to facilitate user interaction.
Implement robust error and exception handling mechanisms using try/catch blocks. For instance, if a user provides invalid input while adding a task, the program should catch the exception and display an appropriate error message.
